/**
 * Proximity magnification — the floating-dock effect, without the dependencies.
 *
 * Items swell as the pointer approaches and settle back as it leaves, each on
 * its own spring, so the row reads as something physical rather than as a set of
 * hover states firing one at a time.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from the React original this is modelled on:
 *
 * It animates `transform`, not `width`. The original grows a square icon from
 * 40px to 80px, which reflows the row and shoves its neighbours aside — fine for
 * icons, wrong for a pill with words in it, where an animated width would squash
 * and re-wrap the text every frame. Scaling leaves layout untouched, so nothing
 * re-wraps and nothing reflows; the magnified item is lifted above its
 * neighbours with `z-index` instead of pushing them.
 *
 * The spring is exponential smoothing rather than a solved second-order system.
 * The original's constants — mass 0.1, stiffness 150, damping 12 — sit well past
 * critical damping (2·√(k·m) ≈ 7.75), so the motion has no overshoot to
 * reproduce. Smoothing toward the target gives the same shape and is
 * unconditionally stable, where explicit Euler on ω ≈ 39 rad/s would need a
 * frame budget this cannot guarantee.
 *
 * Pointer coordinates and getBoundingClientRect are both in viewport space, so
 * comparing them is safe even inside FitSlide's transform — which is why this
 * measures rects rather than offsets, the opposite of the rule for layout maths.
