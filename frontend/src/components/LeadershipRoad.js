/**
 * The Leadership Journey as a process arc.
 *
 * The slide opens as the arc and its titles, nothing else. Clicking a segment brings that
 * chapter's card in on a dotted leader; clicking another brings the next one in and leaves the
 * first where it is, so a presenter builds the picture up and the whole journey is on screen by
 * the end.
 *
 * Everything is solved from one circle rather than placed by hand: the band, the titles, the
 * card anchors and the leaders all come from the same centre, radius and angle list, and each
 * card is turned to its own segment so the content leans the way the band does. Positions are
 * written as percentages of the viewBox, which is what lets HTML cards sit against an SVG band
 * through the slide scaling without being told the scale.
