/**
 * Success Stories as a card carousel that arrives folded.
 *
 * It opens as a single stack — one card face on, the rest tucked behind it with a
 * step of offset each — and one click deals them into a row. From there the arrows
 * walk along it, the centre card sits full size with its neighbours set back, and
 * a card's own View opens the photograph at full size.
 *
 * Every card is placed by one function, for both states. Nothing is measured and
 * no FLIP is needed: a card's transform is a pure function of how far it is from
 * the centre and whether the deck is open, so changing state is a matter of
 * recomputing and letting CSS interpolate. That is also why dealing out and
 * stepping along share a motion — they are the same calculation with different
 * inputs.
 *
 * Photographs are contained rather than cropped, and capped at twice their own
 * pixels. Sixteen of the twenty-five files are 206px square; at their own size on
 * a card they read as small and sharp, which is honest, where filling the frame
 * would enlarge them about fivefold.
